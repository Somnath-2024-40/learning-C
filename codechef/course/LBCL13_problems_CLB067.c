// Else If Statement
// In cases where you have to check for multiple conditions and run some code based on each, you have to use else if.

// The else if keyword means "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition"

// The following example illustrates usage of else if.

// grade = 85;
// if (grade >= 90) {
//     printf("You got an A");
// } else if (grade >= 80) {
//     printf("You got a B");
// }

// // Output
// // You got a B
// The code above works as follows

// If grade >= 90, then it will output: You got an A
// If grade is between 80 and 90 - it will output: You got a B
// If grade is less than 80 - there will be no output
// Task
// Write a program which does the following

// Take two integers b and r as input
// Print "Rob scored higher marks than Bob", if r is greater than b
// Print "Bob & Rob both scored the same", if both b and r are equal
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
 int r = 30;
 int b = 20;
  if (r > b){
      printf("Rob scored higher marks than Bob");
  } else if(r == b){
      printf("Bob & Rob both scored the same");
  }
  return 0;
    
}
